# Usage

</br>

### üöß These docs are under construction / outdated since v2.0 üöß

(New docs soon)

**Write a prompt, associate it with a note type and field, and Smart Notes will automatically generate that field for you at review time ‚Äì or generate groups of notes with a single click**

</br>
</br>

## 1. **Installation**:

Tools > Addons > Get Addon, paste in plugin id `1531888719`. Restart Anki.

## 2. **Start your free trial:**

Tools > Smart Notes.

## 3. **Add Smart Fields**

</br>

**Smart fields are AI generated fields associated with a particular card type.**
They may reference other fields, and you can have as many smart fields as you like.

</br>

1. Click Tools > Smart Notes.

2. Pick the `card type` and `target field` you want to automatically generate.

3. Then, write the `prompt` that will be automatically sent to Claude/ChatGPT to generate the `target field`.

</br>

> üí° **Tip:** Uncheck "Always Generate Smart Field" if you don't want the smart field generated by default, and prefer to generate it manually by right clicking the field in the editor.

</br>

### Writing a Prompt

A prompt may reference any other field on the card via `{{double curly braces}}`.

For example, if you're studying a language and want to generate a mmemonic to aid in memorization, you might make a prompt like this (assuming you have a field called "vocab"):

```
Create a simple, memorable mmemonic in Japanese for the word {{vocab}}. Reply with only the mmemonic.
```

It's often useful to tell language model to "only reply" with the phrase you care about.

_You can't reference the target field, or other smart fields ‚Äì but the addon will validate your prompt, so don't worry!_

</br>

## 4. **Automatically generate notes** üòé

Generate smart notes during review, in edit or add flows, or batched in the card browser.

</br>

</br>

### **Generate during review**

Smart fields are automatically generated in the background at review time.

This is approach is super useful if you import notes via AnkiConnect (Yomichan, etc) - simply set up your smart fields and no further effort required.

_A sparkle emoji will briefly show (we love sparkle)._

Note that you can turn automatic generation off in _Smart Notes > Advanced_.

</br>
</br>

### **Generate when adding or editing cards**

Smart fields can also be generated prior to review. To generate all smart fields on a note, press `ctrl+shift+g` (on Mac: `cmd+shift+g`) or click the ‚ú® button in the editor:

<img src="https://piazzatron.github.io/anki-smart-notes/resources/screenshots/editor_button.png?raw=true" height="200px" />

Clicking ‚ú® a single time will generate only empty smart fields. Click it a second time to regenerate the entire note.

</br>
</br>

To (re)generate a single smart field, right click it in the editor and click **"Generate Smart Field"**:

</br>
</br>

### **Generating Multiple Notes**

In the notes browser, select a group of notes and then **right click > generate smart fields** to generate multiple notes.

**Generate an entire deck** or note type by right clicking it in the browser.
